AWS EC2:\
EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud, which is the cloud computing platform supported by Amazon Web Service. This is important because most of time it is costly for individuals and companies to set up their own computing center for high performance/parallel computing (CPU/GPU). Borrowing the computing power remotely from Amazon can potential save a lot of expenditure. We covered how to create a EC2 instance remotely and how to operate it.\
\
Unix/Linux Command Line/Shell:\
Linux operating system is very stable, secure and versatile. It contains It is the standard system for high-performance computing. The command line is the start point of using Linux. The Unix/Linux shell provides a command-line interpreter for writing and executing scripts\
\
VIM:\
VIM is one of the most popular text editors for cloud service. We can write and modify the text file efficiently using VIM. \
\
Git:\
Git is currently the most popular version control system. Git makes it more convenient to track the programming tasks/projects through branching and merging. It enables multiple programmers to work on a same project efficiently because all the changes are recorded and can be recovered. We covered how to create a new Github repository, how to add/commit/push files to it and how to merge branches.  \
\
Python & PyCharm:\
Python is a popular high-level programming language for scientific computing. PyCharm is one of the important IDEs for Python. Since Python is object-oriented, tree structure can be easily implemented in Python through defining node class. To print the tree node values in level order, we can use BFS to traverse the tree.}
